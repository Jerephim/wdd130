    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jordan, but some people call me JJ. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science, aiming to explore exciting opportunities in software development.</p>
    <p>I love playing video games and spending time with my family and friends. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with cooking and watching tv. I also really enjoy anime. I think that animation speaks to me the most out of all video content.</p>
    <p>I am happily married and have a wonderful one-year-old daughter who brings so much joy to my life. Education is an important part of my journey, and I am excited to learn new skills that will help me grow.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes is, "Always remember, whatever the question, love is the answer." This is a quote from my late Grandma and it is a quote that I hold dear.</p>
