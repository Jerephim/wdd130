            <h2>Step 1: Prepare the Components</h2>
            <p>Before starting assembly, make sure all your components are ready. If you plan to solder the switches, test the PCB first using software like VIA or QMK to ensure all connections are functional. If using a hot-swappable PCB, you can skip this step and test the switches after they are installed into the board.</p>
            <p>This step is crucial. Please lube each switch or purchase pre-lubed switches. I wouldn't recommend pre-lubed unless you really don't want to lube them because lubing them yourself will improve the quality of your board drastically. Disassemble each switch and apply a thin layer of Krytox 205g0 to all 4 sides of the top housing, the left and right side of the stem, none of the metal leaf, a light brushing to all the sides of the spring, and the 4 inner walls if the bottom housing. Be careful to not add too much lube which can make switches feel sluggish.</p>
            <p>Remember, less is more when it comes to switches. I would recommend doing one with a light amount, assemble it, test it out, and then add more depending on how it feels and sounds. If it sticks when it is all the way pressed down that is too much.</p>
            <p>It can be difficult to take apart a switch without a switch opener. but it is still doable. Each switch has four prongs that connect the top housing to the bottom housing. simply insert tweezers in-between the prongs and gently pry each of them back until they pop off the bottom housing. You will need to do this on each switch if you didn't purchase an opener. </p>

            <h2>Step 2: Install Stabilizers</h2>
            <p>Stabilizers are crucial for larger keys like the spacebar, Enter, and Shift. Follow these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insert the stabilizers into the PCB in the correct positions.</li>
                <li>Lube the stabilizers generously with Krytox 205g0. Apply a thick glob to the ends of the stabilizer wires and inside the housing. This will reduce rattle and improve smoothness.</li>
                <li>Perform the band-aid mod by placing small adhesive strips (cut from band-aids) on the PCB under each stabilizer housing. This dampens noise and gets rid of rattle when the stabilizers hit the PCB (Every time you press the key).</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 3: Install Switches</h2>
            <p>Place the switches onto the PCB, ensuring the pins align with the PCB holes. Use slight pressure to push them in. They should click into place easily(a little more force than plugging in a usb); if not, check that the pins are straight and aligned properly.</p>
            <p>If using a soldered PCB, solder the switches after installation. Ensure each solder joint is clean and secure. For hot-swappable PCBs, test the switches after assembly to ensure functionality.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Assemble the Case</h2>
            <p>With the switches installed, mount the PCB and plate into the keyboard case. Secure everything with screws and ensure proper alignment. Double-check that all components are snugly in place.</p>
            <p>For improved sound, consider adding mods like the tape mod. Apply one or two layers of painter’s tape to the back of the PCB. This enhances the acoustic profile, making the keyboard sound more crisp without increasing volume.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 5: Install Keycaps</h2>
            <p>Attach the keycaps to the corresponding switches. Ensure the layout is correct and each keycap fits securely. Double-check for any missing or misplaced keycaps.</p>

            <h2>Step 6: Test and Customize</h2>
            <p>With the keyboard fully assembled, test each key to ensure it registers properly. You can do so easily using the website <a href="https://keyboardtester.com/" target="_blank">keyboardtester.com</a>.</p>

            <h2>Troubleshooting and Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If a key doesn’t work, check the solder joints or ensure the switch is seated correctly.</li>
                <li>Clean and maintain your keyboard regularly to prevent dust buildup.</li>
                <li>Explore mods like the tape mod or PE foam mod for sound and feel improvements.</li>
