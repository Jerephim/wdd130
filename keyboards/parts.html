            <h2>Choosing Your Keyboard Layout</h2>
            <p>The layout of your keyboard determines its size and functionality. Here are some popular options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full-Size:</strong> Includes a numpad, function row, and navigation cluster.</li>
                <li><strong>Tenkeyless (TKL):</strong> Removes the numpad for a more compact design.</li>
                <li><strong>75%, 65%, and 60%:</strong> Smaller layouts for minimalists or gamers who need more desk space.</li>
                <li><strong>Split Keyboards:</strong> Ergonomic designs that reduce wrist strain and allow tenting.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Layouts:</strong> Options like Dvorak or Colemak can improve typing efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ensure your keycap set matches the layout of your board, especially for non-standard or compact layouts.</p>

            <h2>Key Switches</h2>
            <p>Switches determine how your keyboard feels and sounds. Here are the main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear:</strong> Smooth and quiet, great for gaming or shared spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Tactile:</strong> Provide a bump for feedback, ideal for typing.</li>
                <li><strong>Clicky:</strong> Loud and satisfying but may disturb others.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider the actuation force (measured in grams) that suits your needs. Heavier switches reduce accidental key presses, while lighter switches can minimize fatigue during long typing sessions.</p>
            <p>New to switches? Purchase a switch sample pack to try out different options before committing.</p>

            <h2>Stabilizers</h2>
            <p>Stabilizers keep larger keys like the spacebar and Enter stable and smooth. It’s recommended to purchase aftermarket stabilizers for better quality and sound. Remember to lube them generously for optimal performance, and consider mods like the band-aid mod to reduce noise.</p>

            <h2>PCB and Case</h2>
            <p>Your PCB is the brain of the keyboard, and your case provides structure and sound characteristics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hot-Swappable PCBs:</strong> Ideal for beginners and those who like to experiment with switches.</li>
                <li><strong>Soldered PCBs:</strong> More stable but require soldering skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Case Materials:</strong> Aluminum for rigidity, polycarbonate for a softer feel, and brass for a louder sound.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Keycaps</h2>
            <p>Keycaps influence the feel and aesthetics of your keyboard. Here are the main types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ABS:</strong> Smooth and shiny but may wear over time.</li>
                <li><strong>PBT:</strong> Durable with a matte texture, resists wear.</li>
                <li><strong>Double-Shot:</strong> Legends never fade as they are molded into the plastic.</li>
                <li><strong>Dye-Sublimated:</strong> High-quality legends embedded into PBT keycaps.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ensure your keycaps fit your chosen layout and are compatible with your keyboard’s switches.</p>
